        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed programming language used for interactive web applications, supporting both client-side and server-side development, and integrating seamlessly with HTML, CSS, and a rich standard library. JavaScript is a single-threaded language that executes one task at a time. It is an Interpreted language which means it executes the code line by line. The data type of the variable is decided at run-time in JavaScript thatâ€™s why it is called dynamically typed.</p>
